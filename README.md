A beginner's demo for Backbone.js representing a scrapbook app. Note that the server-side functionality is missing -- saving will result in a (catched) error. The backend is assumed to receive and provide JSON data.

This project was started by Herbert Braun and featured in c't Magazin 13/2013. More information about the project: www.woerter.de/textverzeichnis/#filter/id=152 (in German).

Variable names are in German. I'll gladly translate them if there is demand.
